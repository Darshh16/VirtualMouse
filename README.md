# VirtualMouse
This project implements a Virtual Mouse that allows users to control their computer cursor using hand gestures, eliminating the need for a physical mouse. It leverages OpenCV for real-time video processing, Mediapipe for hand tracking, and PyAutoGUI for simulating mouse movements and clicks.
